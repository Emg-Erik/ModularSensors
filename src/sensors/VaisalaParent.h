 * The Sensor and Variable objects for all Vaisala sensors.
 *
 * @ingroup the_sensors
 *
 *
 * This library currently supports the following [Vaisala](http://www.Vaisala.com/en/) sensors:
 * - [Vaisala GMP252-A CO2 sensor](https://www.vaisala.com/en/products/instruments-sensors-and-other-measurement-devices/instruments-industrial-measurements/gmp252)
 *     - [GMP252 Manual](https://docs.vaisala.com/r/kpRtO94gxmNAcexTr5QsJg/x7j2wy~_PuEJ6ylcNcqB3A)
 *     - [Modbus Instructions](https://docs.vaisala.com/r/kpRtO94gxmNAcexTr5QsJg/x7j2wy~_PuEJ6ylcNcqB3A)
 *     - [Class Documentation](@ref sensor_gmp252)

 *
 * All of these sensors require a 12-30V power supply and the power supply can be stopped between measurements.
 * They communicate via [Modbus RTU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus) over [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485).
 * To interface with them, you will need an RS485-to-TTL adapter.
 * The white wire of the Vaisala sensor will connect to the "B" pin of the adapter and the black wire will connect to "A".
 * The brown wire from the sensor should connect to the 12-30V power supply and the blue to ground.
 * The Vcc pin on the adapter should be connected to another power supply (voltage depends on the specific adapter) and the ground to the same ground.
 * The brown wire from the sensor _does not_ connect to the Vcc of the adapter.
 * The R/RO/RXD pin from the adapter connects to the TXD on the Arduino board and the D/DI/TXD pin from the adapter connects to the RXD.
 * If applicable, tie the RE and DE (receive/data enable) pins together and connect them to another pin on your board.
 * While this library supports an external enable pin, _we have had very bad luck with most of them and recommend against them_.
 * Adapters with automatic direction control tend to use very slightly more power, but have more stable communication.
 * There are a number of RS485-to-TTL adapters available.
 * When shopping for one, be mindful of the logic level of the TTL output by the adapter.
 * The MAX485, one of the most popular adapters, has a 5V logic level in the TTL signal.
 * This will _fry_ any board like the Mayfly that uses 3.3V logic.
 * You would need a voltage shifter in between the Mayfly and the MAX485 to make it work.
 *
 * The sensor constructor requires as input: the sensor modbus address, a stream instance for data (ie, ```Serial```), and one or two power pins.
 * The Arduino pin controlling the receive and data enable on your RS485-to-TTL adapter and the number of readings to average are optional.
 * (Use -1 for the second power pin and -1 for the enable pin if these don't apply and you want to average more than one reading.)
 * For all of these sensors Vaisala strongly recommends averaging 10 readings for each measurement.
 * Please see the section "[Notes on Arduino Streams and Software Serial](https://envirodiy.github.io/ModularSensors/page_arduino_streams.html)"
 * for more information about what streams can be used along with this library.
 * In tests on these sensors, SoftwareSerial_ExtInts _did not work_ to communicate with these sensors, because it isn't stable enough.
 * AltSoftSerial and HardwareSerial work fine.
 * Up to two power pins are provided so that the RS485 adapter, the sensor and/or an external power relay can be controlled separately.
 * If the power to everything is controlled by the same pin, use -1 for the second power pin or omit the argument.
 * If they are controlled by different pins _and no other sensors are dependent on power from either pin_ then the order of the pins doesn't matter.
 * If the RS485 adapter, sensor, or relay are controlled by different pins _and any other sensors are controlled by the same pins_ you should put the shared pin first and the un-shared pin second.
 * Both pins _cannot_ be shared pins.
 *
 * By default, this library cuts power to the sensors between readings.
 *
 * The lower level details of the communication with the sensors is managed by the
 * [EnviroDIY Vaisala library](https://github.com/EnviroDIY/VaisalaModbus) TODO add link and info
